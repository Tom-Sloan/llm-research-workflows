# Company Research One-Pager Prompt

I use this prompt when preparing for job interviews or evaluating companies. It generates a comprehensive profile covering founders, competitors, funding history, media presence, and recent news.

The output takes about 10-15 minutes to generate with web search enabled. I usually review and push back on weak sections (especially competitor analysis and network connections) before using it.

## When to use this

- Preparing for job interviews (know the company inside out)
- Evaluating startups before joining
- Competitive intelligence
- Investment research
- Podcast guest prep
