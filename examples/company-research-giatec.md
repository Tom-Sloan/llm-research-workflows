## 7. Interview Questions Generated

### The Contrarian
"The construction industry has been notoriously slow to adopt new technology. After 15 years, SmartRock still represents a small fraction of concrete pours. What would it take to reach 50% market penetration?"

### The Elephant in the Room
"HeidelbergCement invested in 2022, Sika in 2025. Both are potential acquirers. Is Giatec building toward an exit, or do you see a path to IPO?"

### The Competitive Tension
"Converge just raised €20M and is pushing AI-first positioning. EXACT has Lafarge backing in your backyard. How do you maintain leadership when deep-pocketed competitors are targeting the same market?"

### The Failure Question
"You renamed 'Smart Concrete' after trademark opposition from Kryton. What did that teach you about IP strategy?"

### The Future Question
"The $17.5M government grant is funding an AI-driven concrete demonstration plant. What does the concrete industry look like in 2030 if that succeeds?"
